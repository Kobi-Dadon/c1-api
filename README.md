# c1-api
Simple question-answer API

To run locally simple run the (wait for it) run.py (AH HA!).
Then you can use your local address with port 5004 as base such as: http://localhost:5004/submit or http://0.0.0.0:5004/submit.

In order to see the Swagger API documentation simply open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5004/. you can also test over there instead of a dedicated tester such as postman.

The code is also documented in case someone wondered.

Hope you enjoy.
